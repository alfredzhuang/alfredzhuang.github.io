            <p class="about-paragraph">Hello, my name is Alfred Zhuang and I am a fourth-year Computer Science major at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Currently, I'm interested in full-stack web development with the hopes of one day becoming a Software Engineer.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">I love to design and create software applications, with the aim of bringing joy and convenience to others with every application that I create.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">Besides coding, in my free time, I love to travel, work out, and play videogames. During the pandemic, I've also begun to learn how to cut hair and cook.</p>

          <h1 class="about-heading">Background</h1>
          <p>While I learned a little bit of the basics of Java when I was younger, I didn't really get started on properly learning the coding language until senior year of high school. 
            That year, I was given the opportunity to take AP Computer Science A, where we learned the fundamentals of Java. After enjoying my experiences coding in that course, I decided to major in Computer Science.
            In freshman year of university, I brushed up on my fundamentals of Java. Then, in my sophomore year of university, I began to branch out, trying out mobile development with Flutter and beginning to learn full-stack web development.
            In my junior year of university, I spent time learning more about web development and had the opportunity to join Capital One as a Software Engineer Intern. Now, in my senior year of university, I hope to explore more about the different topics in computer science, such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and more through taking elective courses.

            <p class="expandable-text">I joined Capital One as a Software Engineer Intern under the 10 week Technology Internship Program in the summer of 2022. I got to work on a team of over 10 people to help build a full-stack application. In specific, I worked on the frontend portion of the application, focusing on using a tech stack that consisted of React, TypeScript, Jest, and Redux to build out the user interface. I also got the opportunity to integrate our new project with another already existing project where I primarily used React, TypeScript, and Jest to build out the UI. Through that experience, I also got to learn more about GraphQL as it was a part of the implementation that I needed to work with to render information in the UI. In addition to working on this application throughout the duration of the summer, I got to participate in Capital One Coders (a program that focuses on building the future technologists in local communities), where I mentored students that were learning HTML and CSS. I also was able to get the AWS Certified Practitioner Certificate, which I studied and tested for during the internship. I was also able to attend 2 in-person events that were organized by Capital One, where I got to meet fellow interns and associates at Capital One. The first event was held in the office that I was based out of (San Francisco, CA) and the other was held in the headquarters (McLean, Virginia).</p>
